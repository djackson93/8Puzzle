# 8Puzzle
This project was for the Algorithms course at Lamar University. 
The program solves the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm. It uses a shuffle program to run the program with random input (you need a random-number generator) into the 8-puzzle in a loop.  Each instance of the loop enables the user to play a game with different input. *Included are a couple of the test .txt files provided with assignment*
